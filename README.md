# üìå Object Tracking with YOLOv8 + DeepSORT, ByteTrack, and BoT-SORT

This project demonstrates object detection and multi-object tracking using **YOLOv8** for object detection and three popular tracking algorithms: **DeepSORT**, **ByteTrack**, and **BoT-SORT**. It compares their performance and highlights strengths and weaknesses for real-time applications.

## üìΩÔ∏è Objective

- Detect objects (e.g., vehicles) in videos using YOLOv8.
- Track objects frame-by-frame with unique IDs.
- Analyze and compare DeepSORT, ByteTrack, and BoT-SORT tracking performance.
- Optimize FPS and maintain ID consistency in crowded or fast-moving scenes.
